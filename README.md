# Offensive-Image-Detection-using-CNN
Welcome to the CNN-based Offensive Image Detection project! This GitHub repository hosts a robust and efficient offensive image detection system implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the popular VGG architecture.
The widespread availability of offensive and semi-nude images on the internet has emerged as a significant societal challenge, necessitating effective content filtering and moderation solutions. This project addresses this pressing problem by proposing an advanced offensive image detection model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) employing the VGG architecture. 
The use of deep CNNs, particularly the VGG architecture, allows our system to automatically extract intricate features from images, capturing subtle visual cues that are crucial for accurately detecting offensive content.
